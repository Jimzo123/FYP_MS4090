# MS4090 - R for Actuaries
## Structure of the Application

* The code of the application is structured so that each page has a dedicated `ui.R` and `server.R` file, located in the `source-scripts` folder. 
* These often call common functions, stored in the `functions.R` file. 
* The `app.R` file calls these other scripts, and runs the application.
